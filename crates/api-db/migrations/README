To add a new migration:
1) Make sure you have sqlx-cli installed
   cargo install sqlx-cli --no-default-features --features postgres
2) In the <REPO_ROOT>/api directory, do
   sqlx migrate add <migration_name>
Migrations are applied only once and sqlx knows not to apply migrations
already applied, as it keeps track of already applied migrations in
the _sqlx_migrations table in the DB.
